# Week 7 â€” Solving CORS with a Load Balancer and Custom Domain

If you come accross any error that says 9 sessions active use the script below to kill all connections.
```bash
SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid) 
FROM pg_stat_activity 
WHERE 
-- don't kill my own connection!
pid <> pg_backend_pid()
-- don't kill the connections to other databases
AND datname = 'cruddur';
```

## Fargate Configuration
Create `register` script 
For Backend
```bash
#! /usr/bin/bash

ABS_PATH=$(readlink -f "$0")
FRONTEND_PATH=$(dirname $ABS_PATH)
BIN_PATH=$(dirname $FRONTEND_PATH)
PROJECT_PATH=$(dirname $BIN_PATH)
TASK_DEF_PATH="$PROJECT_PATH/aws/task-definitions/backend-flask.json"

echo $TASK_DEF_PATH

aws ecs register-task-definition \
--cli-input-json "file://$TASK_DEF_PATH"
```
For Frontend
```bash
#! /usr/bin/bash

ABS_PATH=$(readlink -f "$0")
BACKEND_PATH=$(dirname $ABS_PATH)
BIN_PATH=$(dirname $BACKEND_PATH)
PROJECT_PATH=$(dirname $BIN_PATH)
TASK_DEF_PATH="$PROJECT_PATH/aws/task-definitions/frontend-react-js.json"

echo $TASK_DEF_PATH

aws ecs register-task-definition \
--cli-input-json "file://$TASK_DEF_PATH"
```

## Domain


## Generated env vars scripts using Ruby
For Frontend 
```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

require 'erb'

template = File.read 'erb/frontend-react-js.env.erb'
content = ERB.new(template).result(binding)
filename = "frontend-react-js.env"
File.write(filename, content)
```
For Backend
```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

require 'erb'

template = File.read 'erb/backend-flask.env.erb'
content = ERB.new(template).result(binding)
filename = "backend-flask.env"
File.write(filename, content)
```
## To create network using docker
```
docker network create cruddur-net
```
